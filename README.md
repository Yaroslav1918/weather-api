## 🚀 How it Works

1. A user subscribes with their email, a city, and frequency.
2. A confirmation email is sent with a link.
3. Once confirmed, the user is saved with `confirmed: true`.
4. The service uses an external weather API to fetch data.
5. Subscriptions are stored in MongoDB.

## 📩 API Endpoints

- `POST /subscribe`  
  → Create a new subscription

- `GET /confirm/:token`  
  → Confirm a subscription via token

- `GET /unsubscribe/:token`  
  → Cancel a subscription via token

- `GET /weather?city=Kyiv`  
  → Get current weather for a city
